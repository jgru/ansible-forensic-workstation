* ansible-forensic-workstation
In order to be able to quickly setup and configure a machine to perform forensic tasks, I built an Ansible-based playbook with different roles to provide a basic pre-configured environment of the software packages to start working.

Please note, that this is work in progress for my personal needs.

** Structure of the playbook's files
Modify ~inventory/hosts~ to match your machines and change the given username.
Then you might edit ~playbook/playbook.yml~ to include or exclude certain roles. Take a look into each roles ~tasks/main.yml~ file to see, what packages are installed.

└── roles
    ├── base

    ├── malware-forensics
    ├── network-forensics
    ├── office
    ├── python
    └── shell-environment
#+end_src

** Using the playbook

*** How to install
Make sure to install ~ansible~ for ~python3~ on the controller side:
#+begin_src
pip3 install ansible
#+end_src
Furtheron check, that the box to configure is reachable via SSH without a password prompt (use ~ssh-copy-id~ to transfer your keys, if not)

**** How to run the playbook
After modifying the ~hosts~ file run the playbook to provision a box
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbook/playbook.yml --ask-become-pass -vvv
#+END_SRC
